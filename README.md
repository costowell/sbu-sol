# Pro Wrestling Solution

I initially made a pure JavaScript solution in `initial.js`, but decided to rewrite it in TypeScript in `app.ts`.

My more polished submission is my `app.ts`.

## Compiling

To compile the typescript version

```bash
tsc
```

## Running

You can run either using the following

```bash
node app.js
node initial.js
```
